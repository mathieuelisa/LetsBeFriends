## CONTEXT

LET’S BE FRIENDS is a project proposed by me to end our 5 month training with the O’clock school. <br>
The goal of this project was to be immersed during 4 weeks in conditions similar to the professional world:

- **Sprints**
- **MVP**
- **Wireframes**
- **MCD**
- **Daily Briefings**

Regarding the composition of my team, I had the chance to collaborate with 4 others developers.<br>
We were therefore 2 front developers and 3 back developers.
For this project, I had the opportunity to wear two hats: `Product owner` and `Lead Dev Front`.

If you want to see the presentation of the project live on youtube, just follow the link below

## MY PROJECT

Let’s be friend is an application that tries to touch originality with the tip of a finger by allowing one or more users to learn or practice a foreign language through events.
These events can take differents forms such as picnics, evenings at the user's home, or even a weekend together, the choices are very unlimited.
